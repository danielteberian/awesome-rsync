# awesome-rsync
A curated list of addresses that you can mirror! I have been interested in data-hoarding, and rsync has been perfect for mirroring tons of data. If you are into having tons of files, all available on your machine, then you are in the right place! I will add new addressess as I find them. If you find any addresses that you would like to see added, create an issue, and I will add whatever you suggest. Happy mirroring! :)
